🚀 LeadGen Pro 2026: The B2B Outreach Engine
LeadGen Pro is a high-performance, automated B2B lead discovery and outreach platform. It bridges the gap between raw data and closed deals by automating the entire pipeline: Discovery → Verification → Outreach.

💎 The Solution
Manual lead sourcing is slow, expensive, and prone to human error. LeadGen Pro reduces sourcing time by 90%, allowing businesses to focus on closing deals rather than finding emails.

Speed: 5+ high-intent leads processed and contacted every 60–120 seconds.

Efficiency: Integrated cloud intelligence allows the engine to get faster the more it is used.

Safety: Built-in anti-collision logic ensures your brand never contacts the same business twice.

🛠️ System Architecture (The "Brain")
This project showcases a sophisticated decoupled architecture designed for stability and scale:

Frontend Interface: A streamlined, user-friendly dashboard for campaign management and real-time monitoring.

Scraping Engine: A robust backend powered by Playwright that navigates the web like a human to find hidden contact data.

Cloud Memory: A Supabase (PostgreSQL) backbone that acts as a "Global Brain," storing millions of data points to provide instant results for common searches.

Outreach Layer: A secure SMTP integration for high-deliverability cold email campaigns.

🚀 Key Business Features
1. Global Lead Intelligence
The system doesn't just scrape; it learns. By utilizing a global database, the engine can "skip" the scraping phase for known businesses, providing instant outreach capabilities for verified leads.

2. Multi-Tenant Lead Tracking
Designed for scale. While the intelligence is shared globally, outreach history is private. Every user has a dedicated workspace to track their specific conversions and follow-ups.

3. Verification Engine
Our logic doesn't just grab any email; it filters for business-grade contacts, ignoring junk and technical addresses to protect your sender reputation.
